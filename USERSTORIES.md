# Documentary Proof of the Execution of the Quality Assurance Measures

:with_toc_data

## Introduction

At the very beginning of this project, we created a document ("Qualit√§tssicherungsdokument") that outlined certain quality goals which were to be met by the software as well as measures and practices for the developers to adhere to in order to reach these quality goals. Here is a __shortened__ check-list-style summary of these goals:

1. __Ease of Use__
	1. The user interface has to be visually consistent/coherent. Therefore, all UI elements must be part of Twitter's Bootstrap framework.
	2. Each feature has to be accessible with no more than three clicks.

2. __Functionality__
	1. Each feature has to be described in a user story before its being implemented. This way, possible misunderstandings can be sorted out before one line onf code is being written.
	2. Each user story comes with at least one so-called "acceptance test", which precisely (click-by-click) describes a scenario in which the new functionality is being applied. A user story may not be considered done until the test associated with it passed.
	3. Towards the end of the development, one or more "usability tests" have to be conducted. A usability test consists of several questions to be answered by potential users of the software. The goal is to find out how satisfied they are with it and what they want to be done differently.

3. __Analyzability (or "Understandability of the Source Code")__
	1. Each source code change (addition, modification, or deletion) has to be associated with either
		+ a user story or
		+ a bug that is being tracked with the GitHub bug tracker.
	2. Therefore, all so-called "pull requests" have to come with either a user story id or a bug id.
	3. Each method has to come with a JavaDoc-style comment right above its signature that describes its what it does, its parameters, etc.

As the title suggests, it is the purpose of this document to either proove that these goals have been reached or document the reasons why some of them could not be realized. `TO BE CONTINUED`

## Problems

+ Is the "userManagment" repo relevant for this document? Why is it not part of the back end repo?
+ There are many, many pull requests that cannot be associated with a user story! What to do with them? (`BF` stands for *bug fix*, `US` means that *there should be a user story for this pull request*, `?` indicates that I have no idea what this is.)
	+ Unassociated pull requests from the back end:
		+ \#2 `?`
		+ \#5 `BF`
		+ \#13 `BF`
		+ \#14 `BF`
		+ \#15 `?`
		+ \#18 `US` (Implement functionality triggered by routes for getting projects and canvases)
		+ \#19 `BF`
		+ \#21 `US` (Implement canvas deletion)
		+ \#22 `US` (Implement canvas creation)	
	+ Unassociated pull request from the front end:
		+ \#1 `BF`
		+ \#2 `?`
		+ \#3 `?`
		+ \#8 `?`
		+ \#9 `BF`
		+ \#17 `BF`
		+ \#19 `BF`
		+ \#22 `US` (Implement project view and canvas edit view)
		+ \#28 `BF`
		+ \#29 `US`/`BF`? (Increase canvas size when editing it)
		+ \#30 `US` (Add profile and edit profile views, some little tweaks)
		+ \#31 `US` (Implement canvas deletion)
		+ \#32 `BF`
		+ \#33 `US` (Implement canvas creation)
	+ __Please create an entry within the GitHub issue tracker for each pull request marked `BF`!__
	+ __Please create a user story and submit it to me for each pull request marked `US`!__
	+ __If you authored a `?` pull request, please explain to me what it does!__

## User Stories

### User Story #1: Registration of User Accounts
+ __Velocity__: 10 Points
+ __Description__: As a person, I want to be able to register an account on a Paperdreamer instance. I want to enter my user name, email address and password and confirm the data to register myself as a user. This user account is not functional until an administrator confirms it.
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: After registering as a user called "Test User" with the email address testuser@paperdreamer.org, one has to verify that the user account is created in the database, but logging in will fail until an administrator enables it.
+ __Implementation__:
	+ __Back end pull request #3: Server-side validation of registration data__
	+ __Back end pull request #4: User lists and activating users__
	+ __Back end pull request #7: Mail service__
	+ __Front end pull request #4: Implement registration and notifications__
	+ __Front end pull request #7: Implement settings factory and refactor the registration__

### User Story #2: Changing User Account Passwords
+ __Velocity__: 10 Points
+ __Description__: As a user, I want to be able to change the password that I use to log in to the Paperdreamer platform. For security purposes, I want to be forced to enter my current password twice before entering my desired password (twice, also). The next time I want to log in, I want to be able to do so using the new password.
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: Using the login credentials of "Test User", one has to log in to the Paperdreamer platform using the generated password. Then, one has to change "Test User"'s password like described above. If, afterwards, loggin in with the new password works, this test can be considered done.
+ __Implementation__:
	+ `TODO: NO MATCHING BACK END PULL REQUEST`
	+ __Front end pull request #7:  Implement settings factory and refactor the registration__ `?`

### User Story #3: Receiving an Email After Registration 
+ __Velocity__: 4 Points
+ __Description__: After registering on a Paperdreamer instance, I will receive an email, where I need to confirm the entered data by clicking on a link. After this, the account will show up in the list of users for the administrator(s) to confirm.
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: After registering as a user, one has to verify the provided data by clicking on a link in a received email. After the link has been clicked by the newly registered user, this user needs to show up in the list of unconfirmed users (which can only be accessed by administrators).
+ __Implementation__:
	+ __Back end pull request #7: Mail service__


### User Story #4: Confirming User Accounts
+ __Velocity__: 6 Points
+ __Description__: As an administrator, I want to be able to confirm user accounts. After registering as user, the account is not activated, until I (or another administrator) enables it, by choosing to reject or accept it.
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: After registering as a user, my account is disabled and I cannot login. One has to verify that after confirming the account as administrator, the new user can log in with the data he entered in the original registration process.
+ __Implementation__:
	+ __Back end pull request #4: User lists and activating users__
	+ __Front end pull request #5: Implement user stories #4, #5 and #6__


### User Story #5: List of Not Yet Activated Users
+ __Velocity__: 10 Points
+ __Description__: As an administrator, I want to see a list of user accounts which I need to accept or reject.
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: After registering as a new user, I login as administrator and can open the list of unconfirmed users. One has to confirm that the new user shows up in the list.
+ __Implementation__:
	+ __Back end pull request #4: User lists and activating users__
	+ __Front end pull request #5: Implement user stories #4, #5 and #6__

### User Story #6: List of All Users
+ __Velocity__: 10 Points
+ __Description__: As an administrator, I want to see a list of all users in the system.
Once I am logged in as administrator, I can open a view of all registered users. This view will show at least each user name and the associated permissions ("Administrator" or "User").
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: After creating a new user ("Test User"), I can login as administrator and open the user view. "Test User" will show up with the associated permission being "User".
+ __Implementation__:
	+ __Back end pull request #4: User lists and activating users__
	+ __Front end pull request #5: Implement user stories #4, #5 and #6__


### User Story #7: Promoting Users
+ __Velocity__: 8 Points
+ __Description__: As an administrator, I want to be able to promote users to admins. Once I am logged in a user account with administrator privileges, I can open the user view, where I can change the permissions of each user. The following system wide permissions are supported: Administrator (not-deleteable, "God" mode), Administrator (deleteable) and User. Non-deletable administrators can only be promoted by another non-deleteable administrators, the same is true for changing the permissions of user from "Administrator" to "User".
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: After creating a new user ("Test User"), I can login as administrator and change his permissions to "Administrator". After logging out, I can login with "Test User" and change permissions as well.
+ __Acceptance Test #2__: After creating a new user ("Test User"), I can login as "God" administrator and change his permissions to "Administrator, non-deletable". After confirming my choice, deleting "Test User" is not possible.
+ __Implementation__:

	+ __Front end pull request #13:  Make admin userlist roles dropdowns, add methods for changing roles to controller and factory__

### User Story #8: Profile View
+ __Velocity__: `TODO`
+ __Description__: As a user, I want to be able to view my profile as well as other users' profiles. After I login to my account by clicking "View Your Profile" (or something similar), I want to be able to see my current profile information such as my avatar, user name, email address (and other personal information the user has provided). By clicking someone else's username I want to be able to view their profile.

The login button will be unclickable unless both fields are filled with information that fits the format. If, and only if, the provided credetials were correct, access is being granted after clicking the login button. Otherwise, there will be an error message popping up.
+ __Acceptance Test #1__: Try to log in with fictional credentials. There should be an error message saying that the provided credentials weren't accepted.
